# Part I: Context

## What is Statistics?

Statistics is a science.
As a result, it follows a set of well-defined steps or methods.
As we explore new terms and definitions, we will gain a better understanding of what statistics encompasses.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## **DEFINITION**: Statistics

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, communicating, and visualizing data and information.
:::

There are a multitude of ways to describe the steps, terms, and various processes undertaken in a statistical study.
Importantly, however, modern statistics calls for more critical questions where we explore difference or change within specified contexts.
We then use theory and concepts of variation to understand differences within or between a set (or sets) of measurements, resulting in a more *critical* orientation to statistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Critical Statistics?

In popular media\index{media}, we might see information\index{information} reported as follows:

> *In 2022, college enrollment for 18-24 year-olds in the United States was 39%, a two percent decrease from 41% in 2012. The enrollment rate for those aged 18-24 in 2022 who were Black was 36%, which was lower than the rates for Asian students, which was 61%, and White students, which was 41%*.

The data above is from the U.S.
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)\index{NCES}.
While reading the paragraph, what were some of your opinions?
What questions did you have?

-   How was enrollment defined and measured?

-   Should the differences be viewed as significant in some way?

-   Do the percents mean that some students are less likely to go to college?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In traditional statistics, a quantitative research question is answered using the scientific method.
A *traditionalist* may blindly follow the steps of this method, focusing on model selection and assumptions while also ignoring any broader social and historical contexts.

In the social sciences, for example, statistics continues to be used to perpetuate negative stereotypes -- which does not simply give it a bad rap but it results in real-world harm to communities.
Does this mean we are just in need of *critical* statistics?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
### **Example**: Challenging Statistics in Media

The American sitcom *A Different World* challenged negative stereotypes associated with Black youth and families regarding the pursuit of higher education\index{higher education}.
By portraying a vibrant college life at Hillman, a predominately Black college in the U.S.\index{HBCU}, the series highlighted the importance of education as a priority within the Black community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## Practice

In a discussion about the U.S. college enrollment rate of Black 18-24 year-olds, your colleague Rachel cites Bill Cosby and two shows that he produced, *A Different World* and *The Cosby Show*, as important examples to combat deficit racial stereotypes.
However, during the discussion, another colleague mentions how Bill Cosby was found guilty of aggravated indecent assault and sexual predation, and mentions that we have to be mindful of the work we cite and the persons responsible for producing the work.
The colleague states that \`\`one problematic case should not be combated with another problematic case" referring to Cosby; Rachel disagrees. Both colleagues ask for your opinion on the discussion. How might you respond?
:::

## A Different World of Statistics

The idea of *traditional statistics* vs. *non-traditional statistics* may mean, on the surface at least, that we are in need of a *critical* statistics, and fast.
But what if this dichotomy is a false one\index{false dichotomy}?
What other pathways exist?
Pathways of refusal?
Pathways of exploration?

We will make attempts to reside in the space between refusal\index{refusal} and exploration\index{exploration}, as two key aspects of what we will come to know as *critical statistics*.
By employing a practice of refusal, we will have space to *refuse* harmful beliefs and scientific practices.
In the spirit of learning, we will also *explore* the potential benefits (and drawbacks) of critical statistics.

::: callout-tip
### Traditional approaches to statistics

Critical approaches to statistics require interdisciplinary thinking.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traditional approaches to statistics in some areas of study, like the environmental sciences, provide important information about changes and differences in global patterns.
In other areas of study, such as education and the social sciences, statistics has a different history.

In the specific case of U.S. college enrollment rates, you may be concerned with some broader questions about data in the education sciences.
In the spirit of *exploration*, you might ask:

-   Should we interpret these enrollment statistics as indicative of broader societal issues affecting access to higher education?

-   What are the historical and systemic barriers that could explain the differences in enrollment rates among students?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, in the spirit of *refusal*, some different questions come to the surface:

-   What beliefs underlie the analysis of college enrollment rates?

-   What assumptions are being made when quantifying educational pathways?

-   How does rejecting conventional racial comparisons challenge power dynamics?

This second set of questions, as early examples of a practice of refusal, encourage your critical thinking in a few ways.
First, the questions ask you to think about the less explicit components of the paragraph.
Second, the questions present an option to reject conventional approaches to how we measure educational outcomes and ask why.
Third, and to the seeming contradiction between refusal and exploration, a set of new pathways arise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## Practice

Bad Stats (or BS)\index{Bad Stats}, outlined by Professor Ivory Toldson, are data points that are poorly contextualized, generally negative, and they are often incomplete or incorrect.
They are part of a problematic trend in which statistics are used to reinforce negative stereotypes.
Identify two examples of *Bad Stats* in popular media.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Big Picture

Pelham (2013) defines "statistics \[as\] a set of mathematical procedures for summarizing and interpreting observations" (p.5).
Pelham describes *descriptive* statistics as "statistics used to summarize or describe a set of observations", whereas *inferential* statistics are defined as "statistics used to draw inferences about a set of observations" (p. 5).

Some key concepts:

-   Population parameter: A numerical characteristic of an entire population, often unknown and estimated using sample data.

-   Sample statistic: A numerical value calculated from a sample to estimate a population parameter.

-   Confidence interval: A range of values that likely contains an unknown population parameter, calculated with a specified level of confidence.

-   Hypothesis test: A statistical method to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data, involving null and alternative hypotheses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): A statistical technique used to compare means across multiple groups, typically used when there are three or more categories of a single variable.

-   Multiple comparisons: Statistical procedures used to control the family-wise error rate when making several simultaneous inferences or comparisons.

-   Interaction effects: A situation in statistics where the effect of one variable on an outcome depends on the value of another variable.

-   Correlation: A statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

-   Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

-   Chi-square tests: Statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables or if observed frequencies differ from expected frequencies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Descriptive measures

**Measures of central tendency**: These describe the "average" or central value of a set of observations.

-   Mean: The arithmetic average of all values

-   Median: The middle value when data is ordered

-   Mode: The most frequently occurring value

**Measures of dispersion**: These describe how data vary or spread out from the central tendency.

-   Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values

-   Variance: The average of squared deviations from the mean

-   Standard deviation: The square root of the variance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#| output: false
#| warning: false

## Sample outline of a bivariate regression analysis

# Generate sample data
set.seed(2)
x <- c(2, 2, 4, 4)
```

##### **EXAMPLE -- entering values in R**

Assume we have a small set of data: 2, 2, 4, 4.
We can input and compute this data in *R* using the following code:

```{r, eval = T}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| warning: false

# Generate sample data
x <- c(2, 2, 4, 4)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, eval = T}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| warning: false

# compute the mean
m = sum(x)/4
m
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, eval = T}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| warning: false

# compute the median
median(x)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, eval = T}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| warning: false

# compute the mode
mode(x)
table.x <- table(x)
table.x
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, eval = T}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
#| warning: false

# create a histogram
hist(x)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You also may recall the standard deviation, $S$, of a set of values is calculated using: $$ S = \sqrt{\dfrac{\Sigma (x - m)^2}{n}}$$

##### **EXAMPLE -- Standard deviation of a set**

Assume we have a small set of data: 2, 2, 4, 4.
Using the formula for standard deviation above, where $x$ is the score, $m$ is the mean (sometimes referred to as $\bar{x}$), and $n$ is the sample size, we get the following:

$$\dfrac{(2-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (4-3)^2}{4} = \dfrac{1 + 1 + 1 + 1}{4} = 1 $$ Most formulas of this nature are programmed into *R/RStudio*, but for more advanced modeling, we learn how to input raw data and formula into the software.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Inferential measures

Pelham notes that "the basic idea behind inferential statistical testing is that decisions about what to conclude from a set of research findings need to be made in a logical, unbiased fashoion" (p. 13).
However, with a more critical lens on the development of statistics and some of the assumptions made in the mathematical models, we need to consider more concretely about the role of **theory** and **context** in making inferences about data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What should it mean to be critical in the context of statistics?

### Notes from *Duncan (n.d.)* reading.

On Canvas, in the Week 2 folder, there is a document titled "Critical Thinking" by Jennifer Duncan.
This document is one example of how we can frame what it could or should mean to be critical in statistics.
Please review this document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Using a higher order of thinking**.
    Duncan emphasizes that *critical thinking is a higher order of thinking* with different advanced thinking skills, and offers a few suggestions.

    -   We base our thinking on logic and not on feelings.

    -   We should look deeper into inferences for hidden assumptions or values.

    -   Ask complex questions that help build a critical inquiry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Asking complex questions**.
    Duncan breaks down the process into a few sub-questions.

    -   Who is the implied audience?

    -   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the argument?

    -   What are the underlying assumptions and values?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Using a variety of thinking processes**. Duncan defines a process around *analyzing*, *synthesizing*, *interpreting*, and *evaluating* information that helps with our thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Reflecting on how we answer a question**. Duncan ends with a set of questions that help us think about different points of view, if we have clarity, and if more details are needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The quantification of information can help us understand and represent important situations.
We'll begin by exploring the concept of a set, and how it is defined in mathematics and used to frame various situations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## **DEFINITION**: Set

A **set** is a well-defined collection of elements or items.
:::

A set is characterized by its contents, or what is generally referred to as a set's *elements*.
If we are given two sets, the sets are considered equal if and only if they have exactly the same elements.
The basic relation for sets is that of membership in a particular set.

-   We write $x \in X$ to indicate that the object $x$ is an element (or member) of the set $X$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A FEW IMPORTANT NOTES**:

**Note 1**: We tend to *label sets using capital letters*.

-   For example, we may label two different sets as $X$ and $Y$ or as $A$ and $B$.

**Note 2**: We *use curly brackets* { and } *to enclose the elements of a set*.

-   Parentheses ( and ) are often used to indicate a point like $(x, f(x))$ or an open interval
-   Square brackets \[ and \] are often used to separate sets or to indicate a closed interval.

**Note 3**: We tend to *list the elements of a set using lower case letters* with subscripts, $x_i$.

-   The $i$ in $x_i$ is a subscript that is used as a "position indicator," with $i = 1, 2, 3, ...$
-   We use subscripts to index the elements of a set: $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ and $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## **EXAMPLES -- Sets as a collection of elements or items**

Sets can be defined in many different ways.

i.  Consider a set of electronics $E$ = {laptop, phone, tablet, watch} = $\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\}$

ii. Consider a set of friends $F$ = {Akeah, Brandon, Cris, Daveon, Evelyn}

iii. Consider a set of numbers $N = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$ = $\{n_1, n_2, n_3, ...\}$, so $n_1 = 1$, $n_2 = 2$, ...

iv. Consider a set of sets $S$ = {{laptop, phone, tablet, watch}, {1, 2, 3, ...}, ...}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantifying elements of a set allows us to perform mathematical *operations* on those elements.

Together, the elements and operations combine to create *equations*, *functions*, and *models* that help us understand and communicate details about the elements of a set -- which is a form of data.

We will need a host of math concepts.
The different sets of numbers can be a fun starting point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sets and numbers

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## **DEFINITIONS**: Sets of numbers

-- Natural numbers: $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$

\vspace{.3cm}

-- Whole numbers: $\mathbb{N_0} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$

\vspace{.3cm}

-- Integers: $\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$

\vspace{.3cm}

-- Rational numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \Big\{\dfrac{p}{q}, p \in \mathbb{Z}, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0 \Big\}$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
## **DEFINITIONS**: Sets of numbers, continued...

-   Irrational numbers

    -   any number that is not a rational number; irrational means *not* rational (no ratio)
    -   e.g., you may know some irrational numbers such as $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, $e$ (Euler's number)

-   Real numbers: $\mathbb{R}$

    -   The set of numbers on the real number line
    -   This set is constructed by combining the *rational* and *irrational* numbers

-   Imaginary numbers: $\mathbb{I}$

    -   a number that has a negative value when it is squared
    -   $i$ is the unit imaginary number, $\sqrt{-1} = i$ by definition
    -   so $i$ is a complex number since $i^2 = -1$

-   Complex numbers: $\mathbb{C}$

    -   a number in the form $a + bi$ where $a \in \mathbb{R}$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, and $i$ is an imaginary number

# Part III: Code

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting started in RStudio

In [Lab 0](computing.html), you downloaded and installed base R and RStudio.
In this section, we will learn more about R and RStudio.

Let's start with a little fun!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, install the 'praise' package.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
# install the package
install.packages("praise", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, load the library for the 'praise' package.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
# load library
library(praise)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, get some praise!

```{r, eval = T}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
# get some praise
praise()
```

You can keep inserting the code above to get praise when you need it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Arithmetic in R

We will learn how to calculate values in R.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
1 + 2  # the 'plus sign' computes the sum
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
2 - 3  # the 'minus sign' computes the difference
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
3 * 4  # the 'asterisk' computes the product
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
4 / 5 # the 'forward slash' computes the quotient
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
# from hw exercise 0.2, we can compute the sum of the first 100 positive integers
sum(1:100) 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variables in R

We will learn to give a variable (or character) a value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the different assignment operators

```{r}
y = 2 # the equal sign can be used as an assignment operator

y <-2 # a "less than" sign and dash can also be used as an assignment operator

y # R stores all values you assign, so you must "call" any variables to see their values
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set x equal to two added to three

```{r}
x = 2 + 3
x
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set y equal to two minus three

```{r}
y = 2 - 3
y
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set z equal to two times three

```{r}
z = 2 * 3
z
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overwrite the value of y by setting y equal to x divided by z

```{r}
y = x / z
y
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next module, we will continue our explorations in R by learning how to load data sets into our data frame, and perform some basic operations using some additional packages.
These packages will allow us to consider how we can construct original data sets to develop unique questions for our analysis.

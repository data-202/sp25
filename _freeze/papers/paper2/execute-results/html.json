Specifically, we are interested in understanding the association of individual characteristics as they relate to some broader systems-level issue. For example, we could examine the relationship between income and gender at the individual level to understand the historical practices and development of systems that have contributed to theories relating income and gender.\n\n*Note: For your paper, please remember to address the theoretical relationship that the literature has identified between the conceptual variables selected. That is, before describing the measures and the survey you will be using, explain your theory and why you think that your independent variable is having an effect on your dependent variable.*\n\n# Step 2: Variables, Measurement, Hypothesis\n\nOur goal in paper #2 is to empirically test a hypothesis on a bivariate relationship.\n\nFor example, we might assume that certain individual level characteristics, like income, will inform the likelihood of someone's support for a particular social issue or their membership in a certain political party.\n\n## Path Diagram\n\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| echo: false\n%%| fig-responsive: false\nflowchart LR\n  A[Income] --> B[Strength of support for a political party]\n  A --> C[Religious affiliation]\n  \n```\n\n\n\n\nIn the code below, we will focus on the relationship between `A` and `B`.\n\n## Prepare files\n\nTo investigate the relationship outlined in the path diagram, we will use data from the General Social Survey (GSS). To begin your exploratory analysis, start a new RScript in your `stats-pt2` RStudio project directory and give your RScript a proper preamble.\n\n## Data set\n\nFor paper #2, you will use the `gss_cat` data located in the `forcats` package.\n\nTo test our hypothesis, two survey variables/measures are selected from the `gss_cat` data:\n\n-   **rincome** (respondent's reported income)\n\n-   **partyid** (respondent's levels of support for one of three major US political parties)\n\n### Load the libraries\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### View data in your current R session\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLocate the `gss_cat` data in the `forcats` pacakge.\n\nThis is a data set for us to examine the use of categorical data and `factor` variable types.\n\n### View documentation for your data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?gss_cat\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nView your data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 21,483 × 9\n    year marital         age race  rincome        partyid    relig denom tvhours\n   <int> <fct>         <int> <fct> <fct>          <fct>      <fct> <fct>   <int>\n 1  2000 Never married    26 White $8000 to 9999  Ind,near … Prot… Sout…      12\n 2  2000 Divorced         48 White $8000 to 9999  Not str r… Prot… Bapt…      NA\n 3  2000 Widowed          67 White Not applicable Independe… Prot… No d…       2\n 4  2000 Never married    39 White Not applicable Ind,near … Orth… Not …       4\n 5  2000 Divorced         25 White Not applicable Not str d… None  Not …       1\n 6  2000 Married          25 White $20000 -

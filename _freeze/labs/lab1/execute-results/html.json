Please see the *Preparing Lab Reports* section at the bottom of this assignment.\n\nThe `Lab 1` assignment will reintroduce you to data in the `critstats` package and add a second data set known as `gss_cat`. However, for the lab 1 and paper 2 assignment, you may use your own data set and we can work together to find you a data set that is ready to be analyzed. For new users, I would recommend against data that needs to be cleaned. However, by visiting the case study 2 files, you can learn more about cleaning your data.\n\nThat said, during this lab, you will also return to some of the functions we have used before to clean variables and manipulate data frames. Your analyses in this lab should focus on a bivariate analysis between two categorical variables, two numeric variables, or one numeric variable and one categorical variable.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Learning Activities\n\nBy the end of this lab you will be able to:\n\n1.  Locate data sets in the `critstats` package\n2.  Develop an original research question\n3.  Clean and manipulate data for analysis\n4.  Examine the relationship between two variables\n\nYou should submit your final output on Canvas.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part 0: Pre-lab tasks\n\n-   Create a new RMarkdown\n\n-   Check your working directory\n\n-   Write a preamble\n\n-   Install and/or update packages and load libraries\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Task 0.1: Create a new RMarkdown\n\nIn your R session, navigate to: File \\> New File \\> R Markdown. Create a new markdown file using an appropriate title.\n\n## Task 0.2: Check your working directory\n\nCheck your working directory by typing `getwd()`.\n\nIf you are not in the desired directory, you can change your directory using the associated path. This path should be the same as the project folder that you plan to work out of for the next several weeks.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# insert your desired path in the parenthesis and remove the #\n# setwd(\"/your/working/directory/goes/here\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a new sub-folder manually or under the **Files** tab in the RStudio IDE.\n\n## Task 0.3: Write a preamble\n\nName: <include your full name> Assignment: Lab 2 Date: <here you may want to add a date> Purpose: <insert the goals or purpose of the RScript>\n\n## Task 0.4: Packages and libraries\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install the tidyverse package\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n\n# load the libraries needed for today's analyses\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(critstats)\n\n## update packages if needed; remove # to run code\n# update.packages(\"package-name\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part 1:\n\nIn this part of the lab, you should complete the following tasks:\n\n-   Locate a data set in the `critstats` package or your own data set.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(critstats)\ndata(package = 'critstats')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Recall that you can also use the `data(package=\"critstats\")` command, with a double asterisk, to see a list of data sets in the \\`critstats' package\n\n-   Develop a set of research questions about two variables in your selected data set.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part 2:\n\nIn this part of the lab, you should complete the following tasks:\n\n-   Clean and manipulate your data for analysis\n\n-   Examine the relationship between two variables\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part 1 Reports\n\n## Report 1.1\n\nWhat data set have you decided to use?\n\n## Report 1.2\n\nWhich two variables from your data set will be analyzed?\n\n## Report 1.3\n\nWhat is your research question?\n\n## Report 1.4\n\nWhat is your data analysis plan? Please be descriptive.\n\n## Report 1.5\n\nWhat are some potential limitations for your analysis?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part 2 Reports\n\n## Report 1.6\n\nDoes your data contain missing values? If so, how have you dealt with these values?\n\n## Report 1.7\n\nPlease include all code used to clean and manipulate the variables.\n\n## Report 1.8\n\nWhat relationship, if any, exists between the two variables?\n\n## Report 1.9\n\nHow do these findings relate to your research question and theory?\n\n## Report 1.10\n\nWhat limitations exist as a result of the data analysis?\n\n# Experiencing issues?\n\nIf you experience issues executing your code, it is likely that you have made an error in the previous steps.\n\nRemember that R is case sensitive in all instances, and space sensitive in some instances.\n\nPlease be sure to go back and carefully check your code.\n",

In addition to the requirements outlined in the assignment, the rubric will be used to assess the overall quality of the submission.\n\n| Criteria | Exemplary | Good | Acceptable | Incomplete |\n|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Purpose | The central purpose or argument is readily apparent. | The writing has a clear purpose or argument, but may sometimes digress. | The central purpose or argument is not consistently clear throughout the paper. | The purpose or argument is generally unclear. |\n| Content | The focus of the paper relates to a relevant social issue and includes citations and support from the literature. | The content of the paper provides reasonable support for a social issue but may sometimes be unclear. | The content of the paper is not consistent in its relation to a social issue. | The content of the paper is generally not related to a social issue. |\n| Organization | The ideas are arranged logically and the paper contains the required sections as outlined in the paper assignment. | The ideas are arranged logically for the most part but may not include all required details or sections. | The ideas are arranged in some logical fashion but fail to provide the required details and sections. | The ideas are not arranged logically and fail to attend to the required sections as outlined in the paper assignment. |\n| R Code | All code is original and directly relates to the logic model and theory. | The code is original but may sometimes digress from the logic model and theory. | The code is somewhat original but fails to to relate to the logic model or theory. | The code is not original and does not relate to the logical model and theory. |\n\n: DATA 202 final assessment rubric {.striped .hover}\n\n## Part II: Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive coding help as needed.\n\n## Part III: Code\n\nData analysis examples:\n\nThere is a wealth of information on the web to support your future work in R/RStudio. These sources are useful for analyzing data that you find online and want to perform various tests on. Below, I outline some of these sources that can help extend your analysis as you move forward. I will also note that many of these examples are better selections than current AI software and sites (e.g., ChatGPT).\n\n-   [Using R for Multivariate Analysis](https://little-book-of-r-for-multivariate-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/multivariateanalysis.html)\n\n-   [An Introduction to Political and Social Data Analysis Using R](https://bookdown.org/tomholbrook12/bookdown-demo/)\n\n-   [Modern Statistics with R](https://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/)\n\n-   [R for Graduate Students](https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/)\n\n-   [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)\n\n-   [Data Analysis Examples](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/dae/)\n",

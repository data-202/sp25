The enrollment rate for those aged 18-24 in 2022 who were Black was 36%, which was lower than the rates for Asian students, which was 61%, and White students, which was 41%*.\n\nThe data above is from the U.S.\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES)\\index{NCES}.\nWhile reading the paragraph, what were some of your opinions?\nWhat questions did you have?\n\n-   How was enrollment defined and measured?\n\n-   Should the differences be viewed as significant in some way?\n\n-   Do the percents mean that some students are less likely to go to college?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn traditional statistics, a quantitative research question is answered using the scientific method.\nA *traditionalist* may blindly follow the steps of this method, focusing on model selection and assumptions while also ignoring any broader social and historical contexts.\n\nIn the social sciences, for example, statistics continues to be used to perpetuate negative stereotypes -- which does not simply give it a bad rap but it results in real-world harm to communities.\nDoes this mean we are just in need of *critical* statistics?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n### **Example**: Challenging Statistics in Media\n\nThe American sitcom *A Different World* challenged negative stereotypes associated with Black youth and families regarding the pursuit of higher education\\index{higher education}.\nBy portraying a vibrant college life at Hillman, a predominately Black college in the U.S.\\index{HBCU}, the series highlighted the importance of education as a priority within the Black community.\n\n![Image of 'A Different World' cast](../img/a-different-world.jpg){width=\"50%\"}\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Practice\n\nIn a discussion about the U.S. college enrollment rate of Black 18-24 year-olds, your colleague Rachel cites Bill Cosby and two shows that he produced, *A Different World* and *The Cosby Show*, as important examples to combat deficit racial stereotypes.\nHowever, during the discussion, another colleague mentions how Bill Cosby was found guilty of aggravated indecent assault and sexual predation, and mentions that we have to be mindful of the work we cite and the persons responsible for producing the work.\nThe colleague states that \\`\\`one problematic case should not be combated with another problematic case\" referring to Cosby; Rachel disagrees. Both colleagues ask for your opinion on the discussion. How might you respond?\n:::\n\n## A Different World of Statistics\n\nThe idea of *traditional statistics* vs. *non-traditional statistics* may mean, on the surface at least, that we are in need of a *critical* statistics, and fast.\nBut what if this dichotomy is a false one\\index{false dichotomy}?\nWhat other pathways exist?\nPathways of refusal?\nPathways of exploration?\n\nWe will make attempts to reside in the space between refusal\\index{refusal} and exploration\\index{exploration}, as two key aspects of what we will come to know as *critical statistics*.\nBy employing a practice of refusal, we will have space to *refuse* harmful beliefs and scientific practices.\nIn the spirit of learning, we will also *explore* the potential benefits (and drawbacks) of critical statistics.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Traditional approaches to statistics\n\nCritical approaches to statistics require interdisciplinary thinking.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTraditional approaches to statistics in some areas of study, like the environmental sciences, provide important information about changes and differences in global patterns.\nIn other areas of study, such as education and the social sciences, statistics has a different history.\n\nIn the specific case of U.S. college enrollment rates, you may be concerned with some broader questions about data in the education sciences.\nIn the spirit of *exploration*, you might ask:\n\n-   Should we interpret these enrollment statistics as indicative of broader societal issues affecting access to higher education?\n\n-   What are the historical and systemic barriers that could explain the differences in enrollment rates among students?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlternatively, in the spirit of *refusal*, some different questions come to the surface:\n\n-   What beliefs underlie the analysis of college enrollment rates?\n\n-   What assumptions are being made when quantifying educational pathways?\n\n-   How does rejecting conventional racial comparisons challenge power dynamics?\n\nThis second set of questions, as early examples of a practice of refusal, encourage your critical thinking in a few ways.\nFirst, the questions ask you to think about the less explicit components of the paragraph.\nSecond, the questions present an option to reject conventional approaches to how we measure educational outcomes and ask why.\nThird, and to the seeming contradiction between refusal and exploration, a set of new pathways arise.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Practice\n\nBad Stats (or BS)\\index{Bad Stats}, outlined by Professor Ivory Toldson, are data points that are poorly contextualized, generally negative, and they are often incomplete or incorrect.\nThey are part of a problematic trend in which statistics are used to reinforce negative stereotypes.\nIdentify two examples of *Bad Stats* in popular media.\n:::\n\n# Part II: Content\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Big Picture\n\nPelham (2013) defines \"statistics \\[as\\] a set of mathematical procedures for summarizing and interpreting observations\" (p.5). Pelham describes *descriptive* statistics as \"statistics used to summarize or describe a set of observations\", whereas *inferential* statistics are defined as \"statistics used to draw inferences about a set of observations\" (p. 5).\n\nSome key concepts:\n\n-   Population parameter: A numerical characteristic of an entire population, often unknown and estimated using sample data.\n\n-   Sample statistic: A numerical value calculated from a sample to estimate a population parameter.\n\n-   Confidence interval: A range of values that likely contains an unknown population parameter, calculated with a specified level of confidence.\n\n-   Hypothesis test: A statistical method to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data, involving null and alternative hypotheses.\n\n---\n\n-   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): A statistical technique used to compare means across multiple groups, typically used when there are three or more categories of a single variable.\n\n-   Multiple comparisons: Statistical procedures used to control the family-wise error rate when making several simultaneous inferences or comparisons.\n\n-   Interaction effects: A situation in statistics where the effect of one variable on an outcome depends on the value of another variable.\n\n-   Correlation: A statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n\n-   Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n\n-   Chi-square tests: Statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables or if observed frequencies differ from expected frequencies.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Descriptive measures\n\n**Measures of central tendency**: These describe the \"average\" or central value of a set of observations.\n\n  - Mean: The arithmetic average of all values\n\n  - Median: The middle value when data is ordered\n\n  - Mode: The most frequently occurring value\n\n**Measures of dispersion**: These describe how data vary or spread out from the central tendency.\n\n  - Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values\n  \n  - Variance: The average of squared deviations from the mean\n    \n  - Standard deviation: The square root of the variance\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### **EXAMPLE -- entering values in R**\n\nAssume we have a small set of data: 2, 2, 4, 4.\nWe can input and compute this data in *R* using the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Generate sample data\nx <- c(2, 2, 4, 4)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compute the mean\nm = sum(x)/4\nm\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compute the median\nmedian(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compute the mode\nmode(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable.x <- table(x)\ntable.x\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nx\n2 4 \n2 2 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a histogram\nhist(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](week02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou also may recall the standard deviation, $S$, of a set of values is calculated using: $$ S = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\Sigma (x - m)^2}{n}}$$\n\n##### **EXAMPLE -- Standard deviation of a set**\n\nAssume we have a small set of data: 2, 2, 4, 4.\nUsing the formula for standard deviation above, where $x$ is the score, $m$ is the mean (sometimes referred to as $\\bar{x}$), and $n$ is the sample size, we get the following:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(2-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (4-3)^2}{4} = \\dfrac{1 + 1 + 1 + 1}{4} = 1 $$ Most formulas of this nature are programmed into *R/RStudio*, but for more advanced modeling, we learn how to input raw data and formula into the software.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Inferential measures\n\nPelham notes that \"the basic idea behind inferential statistical testing is that decisions about what to conclude from a set of research findings need to be made in a logical, unbiased fashoion\" (p. 13).\nHowever, with a more critical lens on the development of statistics and some of the assumptions made in the mathematical models, we need to consider more concretely about the role of **theory** and **context** in making inferences about data.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What should it mean to be critical in the context of statistics?\n\n### Notes from *Duncan (n.d.)* reading.\n\nOn Canvas, in the Week 2 folder, there is a document titled \"Critical Thinking\" by Jennifer Duncan.\nThis document is one example of how we can frame what it could or should mean to be critical in statistics.\nPlease review this document.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Using a higher order of thinking**.\n    Duncan emphasizes that *critical thinking is a higher order of thinking* with different advanced thinking skills, and offers a few suggestions.\n\n    -   We base our thinking on logic and not on feelings.\n\n    -   We should look deeper into inferences for hidden assumptions or values.\n\n    -   Ask complex questions that help build a critical inquiry.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Asking complex questions**.\n    Duncan breaks down the process into a few sub-questions.\n\n    -   Who is the implied audience?\n\n    -   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the argument?\n\n    -   What are the underlying assumptions and values?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Using a variety of thinking processes**. Duncan defines a process around *analyzing*, *synthesizing*, *interpreting*, and *evaluating* information that helps with our thinking.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Reflecting on how we answer a question**. Duncan ends with a set of questions that help us think about different points of view, if we have clarity, and if more details are needed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe quantification of information can help us understand and represent important situations.\nWe'll begin by exploring the concept of a set, and how it is defined in mathematics and used to frame various situations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n## **DEFINITION**: Set\n\nA **set** is a well-defined collection of elements or items.\n:::\n\nA set is characterized by its contents, or what is generally referred to as a set's *elements*.\nIf we are given two sets, the sets are considered equal if and only if they have exactly the same elements.\nThe basic relation for sets is that of membership in a particular set.\n\n-   We write $x \\in X$ to indicate that the object $x$ is an element (or member) of the set $X$.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A FEW IMPORTANT NOTES**:\n\n**Note 1**: We tend to *label sets using capital letters*.\n\n-   For example, we may label two different sets as $X$ and $Y$ or as $A$ and $B$.\n\n**Note 2**: We *use curly brackets* { and } *to enclose the elements of a set*.\n\n-   Parentheses ( and ) are often used to indicate a point like $(x, f(x))$ or an open interval\n-   Square brackets \\[ and \\] are often used to separate sets or to indicate a closed interval.\n\n**Note 3**: We tend to *list the elements of a set using lower case letters* with subscripts, $x_i$.\n\n-   The $i$ in $x_i$ is a subscript that is used as a \"position indicator,\" with $i = 1, 2, 3, ...$\n-   We use subscripts to index the elements of a set: $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}$ and $A = \\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\}$.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\"}\n## **EXAMPLES -- Sets as a collection of elements or items**\n\nSets can be defined in many different ways.\n\ni.  Consider a set of electronics $E$ = {laptop, phone, tablet, watch} = $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$\n\nii. Consider a set of friends $F$ = {Akeah, Brandon, Cris, Daveon, Evelyn}\n\niii. Consider a set of numbers $N = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ = $\\{n_1, n_2, n_3, ...\\}$, so $n_1 = 1$, $n_2 = 2$, ...\n\niv. Consider a set of sets $S$ = {{laptop, phone, tablet, watch}, {1, 2, 3, ...}, ...}\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuantifying elements of a set allows us to perform mathematical *operations* on those elements.\n\nTogether, the elements and operations combine to create *equations*, *functions*, and *models* that help us understand and communicate details about the elements of a set -- which is a form of data.\n\nWe will need a host of math concepts.\nThe different sets of numbers can be a fun starting point.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Sets and numbers\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n## **DEFINITIONS**: Sets of numbers\n\n-- Natural numbers: $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$\n\n\\vspace{.3cm}\n\n-- Whole numbers: $\\mathbb{N_0} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\\}$\n\n\\vspace{.3cm}\n\n-- Integers: $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\\}$\n\n\\vspace{.3cm}\n\n-- Rational numbers: $\\mathbb{Q} = \\Big\\{\\dfrac{p}{q}, p \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\neq 0 \\Big\\}$\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n## **DEFINITIONS**: Sets of numbers, continued...\n\n-   Irrational numbers\n\n    -

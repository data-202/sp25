In writing the paper, you should structure it by using section headings and relevant citations for any referenced work.

## Paper overview

In this paper, you should write about a theory concerning the relationships between and among two variables, that is some dependent variable and particular independent variables (you may have one or more than one independent variable of interest at the outset). After introducing your theory you will use real-world data and statistical analysis to examine the theory.

For review, you may also refer to *more information for course papers* in two additional documents:

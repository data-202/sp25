*Note: For your paper, please remember to address the theoretical relationship that the literature has identified between the conceptual variables selected. That is, before describing the measures and the survey you will be using, explain your theory and why you think that your independent variable is having an effect on your dependent variable.*

# Step 2: Variables, Measurement, Hypothesis

All variables and analyses should be described in detail.

# Step 3: Statistical Analysis

Please be sure to utilize analyses on the interactions between multiple variables.

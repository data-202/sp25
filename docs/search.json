    "text": "Site Description\nThe pages on this site outline the coding components of the DATA 202: Statistically Measuring and Modeling Social Justice course at Howard University, taught by me: Professor Nathan Alexander.\nThe information on this page will serve as a technical companion to our Canvas site.\nThis page will support you in our course in the following ways:\n\nThis page will help you work with data sets and complete small tasks over time.\nThis page will walk you through the measurement aspect of research questions relevant to modeling issues of social justice.\nThis page will help you integrate mathematical ideas and technical formulas into your work.\nThis page will support your use of theory in your statistical practice, and increase your ability to document reproducible code around a set of research questions.\n\nOur canvas site (click here) contains readings and is where you will submit all assignments.\nThis site should be paired with Canvas to help you complete course assignments.\nAnd just for good measure: all assignments should be turned in via Canvas.\nWhen turning in assignments on Canvas:\n\nGenerally, PDF submissions are the way to go.\nI will not download any files not uploaded to Canvas. I will only click on a clearly visible Github repository (i.e., no shortened or bit.ly links). Article citations that include DOIs are preferred.\nWe will discuss Quarto Markdown files which integrate code, formulas, and text. Quarto is actually how I created this site for our course, and it is a great way to communicate your technical ideas.\nThis is a Canvas companion site/page (I’ll use these terms interchangeably) and it will serve as your guide to completing all technical assignments.\n\n\nGiving credit\nThe below websites were used when building this course site. I am thankful for those who have provided open source resources such as these that allow others to generate new products.\n\nDuke University’s STAT 101 course site\nNoli Brazil’s Quantitative Methods in Community Research\n\n\n\nNext up: Overview\nThe overview in the next section will walk you through the technical flow of the course.\nLike this section, a preview of forthcoming topics will be included at the bottom of each page; this means that you can treat this site like a textbook that you would read in order from start to finish. Though I encourage you to explore what else is out there and make use of other resources. That said, submissions should follow the formal guidelines outlined on our syllabus, Canvas, and this site.\n\nThe syllabus provides a high-level view of the course.\nCanvas is the go-to for submissions and provides readings and assignments.\nThis course site provides technical items and code to help you complete your assignments.\n\nComing up next are the four parts of the course and an overview of the assignments for the term. Course topics are outlined in more detail and integrated into the assignment submission schedule on the next page; see you over there!",

    "text": "This page contains three sections:\n\nBrief overview of all course assignments.\nInformation about lab 0 (ungraded).\n\n\nOverview of course assignments\nOur course assignments will be split between reading and typing (code and analytic results).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse component\nAssignment\nDate(s)\n\n\n\n\nPart I: Statistics and society\n\n\n\n\n\nLab #0\nDue: Tue Jan 21\n\n\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\nDue: Sun Feb 2\n\n\n\nLab #1\nDue: Sun Feb 16\n\n\nPart II: Data and people\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper #1\nDue: Fri Feb 28\n\n\nPart III: Data and policy\n\n\n\n\n\nLab #2\nDue: Sun Mar 30\n\n\nPart IV: Data in practice\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper #2\nDue: Sun Apr 20\n\n\n\nPaper #3 (optional)\nDue: Sun Apr 27\n\n\n\n\n\nSample exercises\nBelow are a few sample exercises of the types of problems we’ll explore in class. This work is ungraded, and while there is no prerequisite for this course, these problems should serve as a review and a preview of content that we’ll explore for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions.\nExercise 0.1. If an individual’s projected income is to be converted to a z-score, which of these z-scores would a “rational agent” prefer: -2.00, -1.00, 0, 1.00, or 2.00? What is a “rational agent”? Explain why the “rational agent” would prefer the z-score you selected? Cite any sources.\nExercise 0.2. What is an integer? What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? Explain your solution. Cite any sources. Bonus points (but definitely not required for our course): write a proof of the solution.\nExercise 0.3. Have you ever heard of p-hacking? P-hacking is where a researcher conducts multiple tests and only reports the significant results from those tests. What are some main issues here?\n\n\nLab 0\nFor your first lab, you will install two software programs on your local machine: the first is base R and the second is the RStudio Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. Both programs are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must download both R and RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete assignments, you must download base R and RStudio to your computer.\n\n\n\nRStudio is now called Posit. When you are searching online you will begin to see language differences.\nIt can all get very confusing. In order to reduce confusion, I am requesting that you watch this short tutorial so that we’re all on the same page. I will discuss this more when we meet.\n\n\nNext up: Computing\nOn the next page, I will walk you through downloading the appropriate software for our work this term.",

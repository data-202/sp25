### **Next up**: Preparing for your annotated bibliography

After completing Lab 0, you will use OpenAlex to support your literature identification process. OpenAlex is a comprehensive open catalog of the global research system that can help you find relevant publications for your research. 

Once you are set up in R, try working with the code below:

```{r, eval=F}
library(openalexR)

# Search for works related to your social justice topic
works_search <- oa_fetch(
  entity = "works",
  title.search = c("keyword1", "your specific topic"),
  from_publication_date = "2020-01-01",
  options = list(sort = "cited_by_count:desc"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

# Display the top results
works_search |>
  head(10) |>
  show_works() |>
  knitr::kable()
```
